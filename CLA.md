# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in the open source software projects maintained and managed by European OpenSource.
In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, European OpenSource must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been accepted by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.
This Agreement is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of European OpenSource and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contribution for any other purpose permitted by this Agreement.

By making any Contribution, You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for the Contribution. Except for the license granted in this Agreement to European OpenSource and the recipients of the software distributed by European OpenSource, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contribution.

## 1. Definitions

"European OpenSource" means Fabrizio Cafolla, acting as the project maintainer, and any successors or assigns (including any future legal entity established to manage the Project). In the event of assignment or transfer of the Project, European OpenSource shall provide notice to contributors through the Project repository. Any assignee or successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement with respect to Contributions received prior to such assignment or transfer.

“Code” means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form, that is delivered by You to European OpenSource under this Agreement.

“Project” means any of the projects owned or managed by European OpenSource in which software is offered under
a license approved by the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](https://opensource.org) and documentation
offered under an OSI license or a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses).

“Submit” means the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or otherwise making available code or other content to any
Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of
discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Submission”.

“Contribution” means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to the Project (such as source code, object code, patches, tools, samples, graphics, specifications, manuals, or documentation), that is intentionally Submitted by You to the Project. For the purposes of this definition, “Submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to European OpenSource or its representatives for the purpose of discussing or improving the software or documentation of the Project. Communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution” will not be considered a Contribution. Any Contribution Submitted by You to the Project will be under the terms and conditions of this Agreement without any additional terms or conditions.

“You” or “Your” shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is accepting this CLA. If the Contribution is made on behalf of a company or other legal entity, the term “You” as used in this Agreement will mean both the individual accepting this Agreement and the legal entity on whose behalf the Contribution is made.

## 2. Grant of License

### 2.1 Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to European OpenSource and to recipients of software distributed by European OpenSource a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You agree that You will not assert any moral rights in Your Contribution against European OpenSource, its licensees, or transferees. You acknowledge that in certain jurisdictions, including all EU Member States, moral rights may be inalienable; in such cases, You agree to exercise Your moral rights, if any, in a manner that does not interfere with the rights granted herein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require You to waive moral rights to the extent such waiver is not permitted under applicable law.

You also agree that European OpenSource has no duty to consult with, obtain the consent of, pay, or render an accounting to You for any use or distribution of the Contribution as permitted by this Agreement.

### 2.2 Grant of Patent License

With respect to any patents You own or control, You hereby grant to European OpenSource and to the recipients of software distributed by European OpenSource a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination with or included in any product, work, derivative works, or materials arising out of the Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by combination of Your Contribution with the Project to which You Submitted the Contribution. This license includes, at the option of European OpenSource, the right to sublicense these same rights to third parties.

## 3. Representations and Warranties

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the rights set out in this Agreement. If Your employer or any other entity has rights to intellectual property that You create, including Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer or entity, that such employer or entity has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Project, or that such employer or entity has executed a separate contribution agreement with European OpenSource.

You represent that, except as otherwise disclosed in writing to European OpenSource, each of Your Contributions is Your original work or that You otherwise have sufficient rights to grant the licenses under this Agreement. You represent and warrant that, to the best of Your knowledge, each of Your Contributions does not knowingly violate any third party’s copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

You acknowledge that any Contribution Submitted by You to the Project will be under the terms and conditions of this Agreement without any additional terms or conditions imposed by You that purport to govern or alter the rights granted hereunder. Any such additional terms shall be void and of no effect.

## 4. Notice to European OpenSource

You agree to notify European OpenSource in writing of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make any of the foregoing representations or warranties inaccurate in any respect.

## 5. Effective Date and Project License

This Agreement shall become effective upon the date You first Submit a Contribution to the Project.

By contributing code or other materials to any European OpenSource project in any form including sending a pull request via GitHub, submitting a code fragment or patch via email, or posting to public discussion groups related to the Project you agree that Your Contributions are made under this Contributor License Agreement.

Based on the rights granted in Section 2.1, European OpenSource may license the Contribution under any license, including commercial licenses. Currently, unless otherwise specified in the relevant Project documentation, Contributions to this repository are made available to the public under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3), as described in the `LICENSE` file.

## 6. Scope and Trademarks

This Agreement applies only to Contributions that are intended to form part of the Project’s code base or related documentation as defined in Section 1. It does not grant any rights under trademark law, including without limitation rights to use the “European OpenSource” name, logo, or other distinctive brand features, which remain subject to separate policies and permissions published by European OpenSource or otherwise communicated to You in writing.

## 7. Changes to the Agreement

European OpenSource reserves the right to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. New versions of this Agreement will be published in the Project repository.

Your continued Submission of Contributions to the Project after the effective date of a new version of this Agreement constitutes Your acceptance of the new terms for those new Contributions. Contributions made prior to the new version will continue to be governed by the version of the Agreement in effect at the time of their Submission.
