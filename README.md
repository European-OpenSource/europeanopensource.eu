> üåç **Open to the World** - While we focus on strengthening Europe's digital ecosystem, our vision extends globally. We believe that European innovation in open-source can inspire and benefit the entire world, fostering international collaboration and setting new standards for ethical technology development.

**Connecting Europe's brightest minds and boldest innovations**. European OpenSource is the premier platform uniting developers, companies, and institutions across the EU to build a sovereign digital future powered by transparency, collaboration, and European values.
