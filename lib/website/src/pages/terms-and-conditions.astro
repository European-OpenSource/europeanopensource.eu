    <p>
      These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern access to and use of the europeanopensource.eu
      website (the "Platform"). The Platform is operated by the European OpenSource collective
      ("European OpenSource", "we", "our", "us"), a not‑for‑profit, community‑driven initiative.

    <h4>1. Definitions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Platform:</strong> The website, its subpages, underlying code, APIs (if any) and services
        made available at europeanopensource.eu.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Project:</strong> An open-source software project submitted for listing or showcased
        on the Platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Submitter:</strong> Any natural person or legal entity submitting or requesting listing
        of a Project.
      </li>
      <li><strong>User:</strong> Any visitor or person accessing or browsing the Platform.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content:</strong> Texts, data, metadata, images, logos, marks, documentation, submissions
        and any material displayed on or transmitted through the Platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open Source License:</strong> The license(s) declared by a Project's repository maintainers
        governing its source code.

    </ul>

    <h4>2. Purpose of the Platform</h4>
    <p>
      The Platform promotes, maps and amplifies European open-source projects and digital
      sovereignty initiatives. We do not provide consumer‑facing paid services, do not operate an
      app store, and do not sell products. The Platform is informational and curatorial; listings
      are <em>not</em> endorsements, certifications, due‑diligence outcomes or guarantees of quality,
      security or compliance.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Acceptance of Terms</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Accessing or using the Platform constitutes acceptance of these Terms. If you disagree,
        discontinue use immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supplemental policies (e.g. Privacy Policy, Cookie notices, Manifesto, Submission
        Guidelines) form part of these Terms by reference.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may update these Terms (see Section 16). Continued use after publication of changes
        indicates acceptance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Access and Permitted Use</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Access is free; we may restrict availability for maintenance, security or legal reasons.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must not: (i) use the Platform for unlawful, deceptive, defamatory, harassing,
        discriminatory, hateful, privacy‑violating or harmful purposes; (ii) introduce malware,
        attempt to probe, scan or test vulnerabilities, overload infrastructure, or bypass technical
        or organizational measures; (iii) misrepresent affiliation or impersonate others; (iv)
        collect personal data from the Platform except as explicitly permitted by applicable law and
        our Privacy Policy.
      </li>
      <li>You are responsible for connection costs, equipment and compliance with local laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5. Accounts / Authentication</h4>
    <p>
      If at any time the Platform offers user accounts or authenticated submission channels,
      additional terms will apply. Until then, submissions may occur via forms, GitHub repositories
      or email and you must ensure accuracy and authorization for any data you provide.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Intellectual Property & Licenses</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Platform source code and site‑authored Content (unless specifically stated otherwise) are
        released under the license published in our public repository: <a
          href="https://github.com/European-OpenSource/europeanopensource.eu"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">Project Repository</a
        > (<a
          href="https://github.com/European-OpenSource/europeanopensource.eu/blob/main/LICENSE"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">LICENSE</a
        >).
      </li>
      <li>
        Third‑party trademarks, service marks, names and logos referenced remain the property of
        their respective owners. Their appearance does not imply affiliation or endorsement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Project code is governed solely by the license chosen by its maintainers; European
        OpenSource does not relicense, audit or guarantee compatibility. Conflicts between displayed
        metadata and a repository's actual license must be resolved by consulting the upstream
        source.
      </li>
      <li>
        You grant us the license specified in Section 12 for submissions. You retain ownership of
        your Content subject to that license.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>7. Third‑Party Content, Links & Dependencies</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Platform may reference or link to external sites, package registries, code repositories
        or documentation. We do not control and are not responsible for any external resource, its
        availability, security, compliance or content.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inclusion of a link or Project does not constitute endorsement, partnership or warranty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open source software involves inherent risks (bugs, vulnerabilities, intellectual property
        claims). Users must perform independent evaluation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>8. Security & Responsible Disclosure</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not exploit discovered vulnerabilities. Report suspected security issues to <code
          >security</code
        > \[@\] <code>europeanopensource</code> \[.] <code>eu</code> with enough detail to reproduce.
      </li>
      <li>
        We operate on a best‑effort basis; no bug bounty or compensation is offered unless
        explicitly announced.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>9. Data Protection & Privacy</h4>
    <p>
      We strive to minimize collection of personal data and process any data in accordance with
      Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) and applicable EU & Member State laws. See our <a
        href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a
