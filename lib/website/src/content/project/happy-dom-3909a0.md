name: Happy DOM
description: A JavaScript implementation of a web browser without its graphical user interface.

The goal of Happy DOM is to emulate enough of a web browser to be useful for testing, scraping web sites and server-side rendering. It can also be used by AI to efficiently gather information from websites.

It has currently around 4.5 million downloads a week on npmjs.com. It is used by many bigger organizations, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Airbnb, ByteDance, Cloudflare, IKEA and many more.

  description: The company only has one employee, which is me. The main income for the company is to rent me out as an IT consultant.

I hope that I can get enough of an income from open source to put more time on my project Happy DOM, but also new projects. The sponsorship right now only gives me a couple of cups of coffees each month.
